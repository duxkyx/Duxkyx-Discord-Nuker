# Duxkyx Nuker

A Discord tool with 7 features. This is my first proper Python project (evidently shown by my hideous code), if you would like to leave feedback it would be greatly appreciated, if this goes well I might decide to add more too it.

```bash
  • Mass Ban.
  • Delete all channels.
  • Mass create channels.
  • Re-name Server.
  • Mass message all channels.
  • Mass message targeted channel.
  • Overall Nuker! (all features besides ban)
```

## Installation

Click the green code button above and install, everything is open sourced but feel free to run through virus total.

```bash
  #1: Once downloaded extract to a folder.
  #2: Run the setup.bat to install all libraries used.
  #3: Run start.bat and enjoy!

  If you decide to take some of my crappy code please credit.

```
